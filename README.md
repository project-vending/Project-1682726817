#  Building a data visualization application with Streamlit and AWS S3This project consists of developing a web application using Streamlit and AWS S3 to visualize data stored in a cloud storage service such as AWS S3. The application will allow users to upload their data to the cloud from their local machines and then visualize it with Streamlit. The project will require working with AWS S3 APIs to store, retrieve, and manage the data, and Streamlit for data visualization and user interaction.
